Hi Lina,

I hope you find the monorepo for the assessment useful.

I’ve left the **testing-your-id.users.json** file in case you would like to test with different users.

Please note that most of the **authentication and authorization** are handled by mock services, which use a hardcoded token to validate the mocked credentials. The token is **Bearer mock-token**, and I’ve provided this information in case you’d like to test the Swagger UI with it. When doing so, simply use **mock token**.

I’m excited for you to explore it!

Best regards.
